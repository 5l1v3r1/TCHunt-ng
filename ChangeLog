version 1.1 - 2016-12-18
------------------------

* Newly recognized file-types: OpenSSH keys (public/private), PEM private keys
(RSA/DSA/EC), Keepass password database, Password Safe V3 database, cvs
password text file.

* Ignore symbolic links when strolling through a directory.

* Do not treat ENODATA, ENOENT, EIO as an error, ignore the file instead.
These errors can be encountered when strolling through directories with
special files (i.e. /proc, /sys).

* Recognize content of different sizes. The solution is based on model data
computed from a pool of random data for individual lengths of power of 2 (2^5,
2^6,...).

* Exit gracefully when a signal is delivered to a running instance of the
program and return proper exit code.
