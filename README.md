# TCHunt-ng

TCHunt-ng recursively scans a directory looking for potentially encrypted
files. The code is based on ideas layed out in the project of [Stephen Judge]("https://github.com/stephenjudge") named the
[TCHunt]("https://github.com/stephenjudge/TCHunt"). The original code has aged badly, having unnecessary dependencies; a rewrite that would allow easier
portability seemed like a good idea.
